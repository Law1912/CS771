# CS771A Machine Learning - Homework 1

This repository contains the solutions and code implementation for Homework 1 of the CS771A Machine Learning course (Odd sem of 2023) at IIT Kanpur. The assignment covers various topics, including mathematical optimization, consistency in classification, decision trees for regression, linear regression, and prototype-based classification using class attribute vectors.

## Assignment Structure

### Problems

1. **Another Simple Classifier (20 marks):** Solving an optimization problem to find optimal parameters for a classification model.

2. **Consistent or Not? (10 marks):** Analyzing the consistency of the one-nearest-neighbor algorithm in a noise-free setting.

3. **Decision Trees for Regression (10 marks):** Proposing criteria for feature selection in regression-based decision trees.

4. **Linear Regression viewed as Nearest Neighbors (20 marks):** Exploring the relationship between unregularized linear regression and nearest neighbors.

5. **Feature Masking as Regularization (20 marks):** Deriving a regularized loss function for linear regression with feature masking.

6. **Programming Problem (40 marks):** Implementing prototype-based classification using class attribute vectors on the "Animals with Attributes" dataset.
